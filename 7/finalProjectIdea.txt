My final project idea is to do something different with the ranch for the rich and famous site (which is shall we say is as yet incomplete) but to turn it into a narrative made of pictures I have taken over the years plus snippets of my own writing fitted to them. The conceit that I have in mind is to stage it as something being narrated for my brother or as a conversation between my brother and I. I want to be able to implement various jQuery image slider/carousel plugins, practice working with "chunks" of text, formatted in good web typography and as responsive as I can make it. Though I'm not sure phone size is altogether relevant for the images, certainly I want to make something flexible enough for desktops, laptops and tablets.
